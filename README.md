# ISYS6009 Enterprise Network Security Docker Environment

This repository contains a Docker Compose configuration to set up the required Docker containers for the ISYS6009 Enterprise Network Security course. This environment provides a comprehensive set of tools and services for hands-on learning and experimentation in network security.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/teaching-repositories/ISYS6009-ENS-Docker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   ```
   cd ISYS6009-ENS-Docker
   ```

3. Start the Docker environment:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will download the necessary images and start all the containers.

   **Note:** The initial setup may take several minutes to complete, as Docker needs to pull all the required images. Subsequent starts will be much quicker, typically taking only a few seconds to bring up or down the entire environment.

4. Once all containers are running, you can access the various services as described in the "Available Services" section below.

## Available Services

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Wireshark**: Access the web-based Wireshark interface to analyse network traffic.

2. **Workstation, SecUtils, and Netshoot**: Use these containers for various command-line operations and network troubleshooting. Access them using the `docker exec` command as shown in the table above.

3. **Ubuntu Desktop**: Connect using a VNC client or access via a web browser for a graphical Linux environment.

4. **OpenLDAP**: Use this for experimenting with LDAP authentication and directory services.

5. **MailHog**: A useful tool for testing email functionality without sending real emails.

6. **MySQL**: Practice database security concepts and SQL injection prevention.

7. **Telnet**: Use for learning about insecure protocols and practising secure alternatives.

8. **OWASP Juice Shop and DVWA**: These intentionally vulnerable web applications are excellent for practising web application security techniques.

## Security Notice

This environment contains intentionally vulnerable applications and services for educational purposes. Do not deploy this in a production environment or on a public network. Always use this setup in a controlled, isolated environment.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure all containers are running:
   ```
   docker-compose ps
   ```

2. Check container logs:
   ```
   docker-compose logs [service_name]
   ```

3. Restart the environment:
   ```
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
